# Overview



This package must be installed from GitHub.

```{r, eval = F}
devtools::install_github("josiahparry/geniusR")
```

## Using geniusR

The main function you will be using to acquire song lyrics is `genius_lyrics()`. Supply an artist and a song title as character strings.

```{r}
library(geniusR)
genius_lyrics(artist = "Margaret Glaspy", song = "Memory Street")
```

### Notes:

As this is my first _"package"_ there will be many issues. Please submit an issue and I will do my best to attend to it. 

There are already issues of which I am present (the lack of error handling). If you would like to take those on, please go ahead and make a pull request. Please contact me on [Twitter](twitter.com/josiahparry).
